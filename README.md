1. The Priſoners Plea for a Habeas Corpus, Or an Epiſtle writ by L. C. Joh. Lilburne prerogative priſoner in the Tower of London the 4. of Aprill, to the Honourable Mr. W. Lenthall Speaker of the Houſe of Commons. In which is fully proved, that the Iudges are bound by Law and their Oaths to grant a Habeas Corpus to any priſoner whatſoever that craves it, by whomſoever committed, and to deny it (whoſoever commands the contrary) is to forſweare themſelves, for which they may be in Law indicted for perjury, and upon conviction, are for ever to be diſcharged of their office, ſervice and councell. In which is alſo declared the uſurpation of Mr. Oliver Crumwell, who hath forcibly uſurped unto himſelfe the Office of L. G. in the Army, for almoſt 12. moneths together, and thereby hath robbed the Kingdome of its treaſure, under pretence of pay, which he hath no right unto, and by the power of the ſaid Office hath tyrannized over the lives Liberties, and eſtates of the freemen of England in a higher manner then ever Straford or Canterbury did, all which John Lilburne will venture his life according to the Law of the Land to make good, unto which he hath annexed his Epiſtle which he writ to the Prentices of London the 10th of May 1639 when he was like to be murdered in the Fleet by the Biſhops, as now he is like to be murdered in the Tower, by Crumwell and his tirannicall fellow Grandees.

1. To all the brave, couragious, and valiant Apprentizes of the honourable City of London, but eſp•cially thoſe that appertain to the worſh•pfull Company of Cloth workers, (of which company, if J l•ve I hope to be a Free man.)
